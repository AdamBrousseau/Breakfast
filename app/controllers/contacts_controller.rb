	# Action: index
  	# Purpose: Provide data for index view to list all contact records	   
  	# Functionality: If a search is performed, all contacts matching the 
  	# 				query are returned and paginated with 5 contacts per 
  	# 				page. If no contact matches the query, the available
  	#  				contacts are returned in an instance variable with a 
  	#  				message that no contacts were found. Also sends the 
  	# 				available data to ContactPdf class which is used to 
  	# 				generate PDF document for all the available contacts.
